     *                buttons - Array of button objects for the buttons to show below the lightbox.
     *                          Each button object may have the following properties:
     *                          enabled - Boolean indicating whether the button is enabled. Default
     *                                    is true.
     *                          label - String label of the button.
     *                          positioning - String "left" or "right", depending on which side the
     *                                        button should be displayed. Default is "right".
     *                          primary - Boolean indicating whether the button is the primary
     *                                    button. The primary button is styled in the call-to-action
     *                                    color (typically green) and is selected when the user
     *                                    presses Ctrl+Enter.
     *                          type - String type of the button, used for identifying the button.
     *                                 The following types are predefined:
     *                                 "close" - Closes the lightbox when clicked.
     *                                 "resolve" - Resolves the lightbox when clicked.
     *                                 You can listen to other buttons by listening to the
     *                                 "click button[data-type='<type>']" event.
     *                content - HTML content to display in the body of the iframe.
     *                context - Context in which to execute the promise callbacks.
     *                css - Array of URLs to CSS resources that should be included by the iframe.
     *                      Note that Speakap's "base.css" and "branding.css" are always included
     *                      and don't need to be specified in this array.
     *                events - Map of event handlers to be active on the given HTML content. The
     *                         map follows the same format as used by Backbone's delegateEvents()
     *                         method: http://backbonejs.org/#View-delegateEvents
     *                         Note that these event handlers execute within the context of the
     *                         iframe and thus cannot access any variables from their outer scope.
     *                         Nor will you have access to jQuery methods or other libraries unless
     *                         you include it yourself as JavaScript resource.
     *                         Finally, the "submit" event can be caught (and cancelled, by
     *                         returning false from the event handler) to perform any validation or
     *                         other processing when the lightbox is resolved.
     *                hasScripts - This option has to be set to true to enable the execution of
     *                             scripts in the lightbox. It is implicitly set to true if any
     *                             events or JavaScript URLs are specified, but has to be explicitly
     *                             set to true if you specify inline event handlers in your HTML
     *                             content, for example. An important caveat is that when this
     *                             property is true (whether implicit or explicit) the lightbox
     *                             will *not* work in Internet Explorer.
     *                js - Array of URLs to JavaScript resources that should be loaded by the
     *                     iframe. Note that you need to include your own reference to this
     *                     speakap.js file if you want to be able to use this API from the iframe.
     *                height - Lightbox height in pixels. The minimum permitted height is 100
     *                         pixels, and the maximum permitted height is 540 pixels.
     *                title - Title of the lightbox.
     *                width - Lightbox width in pixels. The minimum permitted width is 100
     *                        pixels, and the maximum permitted width is 740 pixels.
     *
     * @return jQuery Deferred promise that gets fulfilled when the lightbox is resolved, or failed
     *         when the lightbox is closed otherwise.
     *
     * When the lightbox is resolved, the promise callback receives a data parameter that resembles
     * a form submit like those sent with an HTTP POST request. The data object consists of
     * key-value pairs with each key being the name of an input element displayed in the lightbox,
     * and the value being the input element's value.
     *
     * All URLs given for CSS and JavaScript resources have to be absolute URLs.
     *
     * Within the iframe, this speakap.js file is available if you include it with the JavaScript
     * resources, giving you access to the global Speakap object from the iframe (including event
     * handlers defined on the lightbox). Specifically, the following methods can be used from a
